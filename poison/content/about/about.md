Bienvenue!

I am a Swiss-French student presently enrolled a Joint Master’s degree in Cybersecurity (Computer Science) between the **Swiss Federal
Institutes of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and Zurich (ETHZ)**, since September 2023. While pursuing my Master’s degree, my main interests were **Cryptography, Information Security, Software Security, 
Privacy Engineering, Machine Learning and Network Security**.
Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on Software Engineering, Theory of Computation and Mathematics, at EPFL between 2020 and 2023.

I am native in French, fluent in English and I have a standard level in German (B2).

Alongside my studies, I have followed a classical accordion course for 13 year at the music conservatory of Vevey-Montreux-Riviera, 
under the teaching of my professors Christel Sautaux and Aline Roy, until obtaining a diploma in June 2024. 
I also play an active part in multiple accordion orchestras, such as **l'Hirondelle de Prilly** or **das Jugend Akkordeon Orchester Schweiz (JAO)**, and projects, such as masterclasses with professionals or Summer camps for musicians. 
Moreover, I also liked to take part and staff in events at EPFL and socialize with my peers and professors. My hobbies are cooking, reading, photography, hiking and travelling!
