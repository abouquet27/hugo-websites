      <description>Bienvenue!
I am a Swiss-French student presently enrolled a Joint Master’s degree in Cybersecurity (Computer Science) between the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and Zurich (ETHZ), since September 2023. While pursuing my Master’s degree, my main interests were Cryptography, Information Security, Software Security, Privacy Engineering, Machine Learning and Network Security. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on Software Engineering, Theory of Computation and Mathematics, at EPFL between 2020 and 2023.</description>

      <description>This paper was written under the supervision of Nicolas Badoux and Prof. Doc. sc. ETH Mathias Payer from HexHive Lab at EPFL and is available in PDF format on this repository.
&amp;ldquo;Before I came here I was confused about this subject. Having listened to your lecture I am still confused. But on a higher level.&amp;rdquo; - Enrico Fermi
Abstract C++ has a lot of vulnerabilities due to type confusion, which can lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.</description>
